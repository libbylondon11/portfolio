        <h2>Permaculture Research Institute - Cold Climate (PRI) </h2>
        <h4> MY ROLE</h4>
        <p>Wireframing, Usability Testing, Research, UX/UI Design, Mobile Design </p>
        <h4> THE CHALLENGE </h4>
        <p> The Permaculture Research Institute - Cold Climate is a non-profit based in Minneapolis, MN,
        that supports sustainable agriculture and local farms in the midwest.  They had a website that was outdated,
        challenging to use, and had a lot of content that needed to be refined and curated.  PRI had a lot of resources that viewers would like
      access to, but finding anything was challenging.  PRI staff had heard many complaints from users that their site was not mobile-friendly
    and some functions could not be completed in the mobile version.  </p>
        <h4> THE SOLUTION </h4>
        <p> I overhauled the current website and created a new, easy to use, and mobile responsive site. I went through the content and,
          with the help of user research, determined which content to keep and how to organize it.  I changed the overall color and design of the
          site from dark browns and green-moss colors, to more friendly and readable light greens.  I also incorporated larger buttons and
          clear sections of the site dedicated to research, projects, mission, and e-commerce.
        <h4> THE PROCESS</h4>
        <p> I started out by interviewing PRI members, staff, and board of directors to create user personas to guide our design process.
          We determined that retired baby boomers looking for information about large-scale gardening, and millennials interested in food
          justice and/starting their own farms were the main demographic users of the site.
        Based on these user personas, I created a content strategy, and prioritized accessibility because I found that many
          users of the site were over the age of 60 or were using the site on their mobile devices while at farms or gardens.
          I sketched out the flow of the new site, and did a content audit. I organized content using a "tagging" system.  I created wireframes
        for the UI of the site and I created them using mobile-first design principles.  </p>
        <h4>ANALYSIS & PROCESS </h4>
        <p>After desiging and creating the beta site, I created and conducted a usability test.  I targeted our various
        user groups to begin to understand how the site worked for them. The usability test was completed by 10 people and all feedback
      was analyzed and incorporated into the final site. </p>

<h4> Challenge</h4>
<p> The Permaculture Research Institute - Cold Climate, is a non-profit based in Minneapolis, MN,
that supports sustainable agriculture and local farms in the region.  They had a website that was old,
challenging to use, and had lots of content that needed to be refined and curated.  </p>
<h4>My Role</h4><p> My Role: UX Wireframing, Usability Testing, User Research, Mobile Design </p>
<h4> Process </h4>
<p>I worked with a small team of the Board of Directors to understand the users by conducting user research,
  then from there went through the content to decide what to keep, how to reorganize the site, and what
to discard.  </p>
<h4>Time Constraint </h4> <p>2 months</p>
<h4>Analysis and Process</h4>
<p>After desiging and creating the beta site, we created user surveys and tests.  We targeted our various
user groups to begin to understand how the site worked for them. </p>
