        <h2>Nile of the North</h2>
        <h4> MY ROLE</h4>
        <p> Mobile Design, User Research, Front and Back-end Development, Wireframes </p>
        <h4> THE CHALLENGE </h4>
        <p>  Project Sweetie Pie is a community organization that supports urban agriculture and community
          efforts to promote local and healthy eating in the low-income North Minneapolis neighborhood.
          Project Sweetie Pie, along with other northside residents, advocates ongoing efforts to eradicate food
          insecurity by creating a shared vision for North-Minneapolis' food system and community. They believe that
          improving our food system is key to overcoming economic, environmental, and social barriers to health and
          revitalization of their community. They wanted to create a visually appealing map that highlights the incredible
          food resources on the north side (community gardens, restaurants, organizations, and food centers) so that both community
           members and non-community members can start to see North Minneapolis as a place of vitality and abundance. They also wanted community members to
         be able to add resources to the map. </p>
        <h4> THE SOLUTION </h4>
        <p>We decided to develop an interactive story map app to display food resources in North Minneapolis, offering an engaging portal
         to give community members a voice in the story of their neighborhood. We created a user portal for community members
       that wanted to add resources to the map.</p>
       <h4>RESEARCH</h4>
       <p>Project Sweetie Pie and their group of community members, came to us with a general understanding of who
         the map application would be created for.  With their guidance, we walked through the community profiles and users who
         they had interviewed and asked about use before coming to us.  Based off of that data, we learned that most users would be
         using the application from their mobile device, they ranged from teenagers to seniors, and they would be fufilling their need
         to learn more about their neighborhood, bring people to their food resource, and/or use the application to highlight their
         business or farm</p>
        <h4> THE PROCESS</h4>
        <p> We focused on designing a visually appealing map that highlights the food resources
          in north Minneapolis.  While our client assumed that people would naturally discover the map, we thought differently. Based off of
          our basic user research, we designed with two general user personas in mind: the first was was JC, a 17 year old kid living in North Minneapolis
          who works for a local urban farm in the community.  He wants to include his farm on the map to bring in new customers to add their
          farm events to it, and to include pictures and videos from the season.  He has a Smartphone and is comfortable using apps.  The second significant
          user persona that we developed was Evie, a 68 year old north Minneapolis resident who loves to garden and meet neighbors, but she is not
          sure how or where to learn about food related events or organizations in their neighborhood.  She is okay with computers, and likes
          to use the one at the library, but she can't do much more than make phone calls with her phone.  Once we worked through these two
          personas, it was clear to us that making a simple and easy to use site that is mobile and responsive was critical to getting the kind
          of cross spectrum engagement our client wanted. After this research stage, we created wireframes and flow charts of the pages and database tables needed.

          We used the following technologies: Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, Axure, PostgresSQL, Angular.js, Node.js, AngularMaterials.js, APIâ€™s, Leaflet.js.  </p>
