  <p> Project Sweetie Pie is a community organization that supports urban agriculture and community
    efforts to promote local and healthy eating in the low-income North Minneapolis neighborhood that is often overlooked. </p>
<h2> Challenge</h2>
  <p>  Project Sweetie Pie, along with other northside residents, advocate ongoing efforts to eradicate food
    insecurity by creating a shared vision for North-Minneapolis' food system and community. They believe that
    improving our food system is key to overcoming economic, environmental, and social barriers to health and
    revitalization of their community. They wanted to create a visually appealing map that highlights the incredible
    food resources on the north side (community gardens, restaurants, organizations, and food centers) so that both community
     members and non-community members can start to see North Minneapolis as a place of vitality and abundance.
</p>
<br>
<h2>Opportunity</h2>
<p>We decided to develop an interactive story map application to display food resources in North Minneapolis, offering an engaging portal
 to give community members a voice in the story of their neighborhood.
</p>
<h2>My Role: UX Wireframing, Mobile Design, Front and Back-end Development </h2>
<h2>Time Constraint: 21 days</h2>
<h2>Research</h2> <p> Project Sweetie Pie and their group of community members, came to us with a general understanding of who
  the map application would be created for.  With their guidance, we walked through the community profiles and users who
  they had interviewed and asked about use before coming to us.  Based off of that data, we learned that most users would be
  using the application from their mobile device, they ranged from teenagers to seniors, and they would be fufilling their need
  to learn more about their neighborhood, bring people to their food resource, and/or use the application to highlight their
  business or farm. </p>
<h2> Process & User Profile </h2>
<p> Because the project conception belongs to Project Sweetie Pie and the north Minneapolis community members, we had to continually
  make sure that they were getting their main goal met: to have a visually appealing map highlighting the wonderful food resources
  in north side of Minneapolis.  While our client assumed that people would naturally discover the map, we thought differently. Based off of
  our basic user research, we designed with two general user personas in mind: the first was was JC, a 17 year old kid living in North Minneapolis
  who works for a local urban farm in the community.  He wants to include the farm on the map to bring in new customers, to add their
  farm events to it, and to include pictures and videos from the season.  He has a smart phone and is comfortable using apps.  The second significant
  user persona that we developed was Evie, a 68 year old north Minneapolis resident who loves to garden and meet neighbors, but she is not
  sure how or where to learn about food related events or organizations in their neighborhood.  She is okay with computers, and likes
  to use the one at the library, but she can't do much more than make phone calls with her phone.  Once we worked through these two
  personas, it was clear to us that making a simple and easy to use site that is mobile and responsive was critical to getting the kind
  of cross spectrum engagement our client wanted. </p>

</div>

<h2>Development</h2>
<p> We worked as a team of 5 people to design and develop the application. We started out our process by white boarding the views,
  functionality, and database tables needed. From there we determined that anyone using the application can suggest new resources for the map.
  After their suggestion is submitted, these resources will be put in a moderation queue for administrator approval prior to publishing. Users will be able to create an account to update
the content of their resource(s). Each resource will be required to have the following content: address/coordinates,
contact information (name, email), a name/title for the location, a description, and a food resource category.
Community members are encouraged to add their own resources to the map via the user portal or admin portal.
  We used the following technologies: PostgresSQL, Express.js, Angular.js, Node.js, AngularMaterials.js, APIâ€™s, Leaflet.js.
